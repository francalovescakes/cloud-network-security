# Deploying Simple Webservers

By the end of this session you'll have:
  1. 2 Webservers (1 in each private subnet)
  2. 1 Public EC2 to validate your connectivity between subnets via SSM
  3. The ability to test your ELB using Webserver A and B


We're going to deploy 2 webservers, webserver A and webserver B. The intent is that we will be able to hit a public end point and see the load being balanced between the webservers.

### 🚀 Launch two EC2 instances into your private subnet
These two instances will be our two web servers

1. Services > Compute > EC2 > Launch Instance
2. Choose *Amazon Linux 2 AMI* > t2.micro
3. Click *Next: Configure Instance Details*
4. Select the cloud-network-security VPC and the associated __privateA__ subnet
5. Assign the IAM role created earlier with SSM permissions
6. Config as webservers:
    - Expand __Advanced Details__
    - Copy and paste the following in the __User Data__ field:
```
#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
yum install httpd -y
service httpd start
chkconfig httpd on
cd /var/www/html
touch index.html
echo '<html><h1>Rainbows are the c00lest!</h1></html>' >> index.html
```
6. Next until you get to *Configure Security Group* > Select an existing security group
7. Security Group name: __ec2_securitygroup__ (this is the security group that allows HTTP communication with your ALB)
8.  Review and Launch > Launch
9.  Proceed without key pair > Launch

🔁 Repeat these steps and...

- replace __*"c00lest"*__ with another adjective 👍🏽 (We want to be able to easily tell, which websever we're seeing)
- the 2nd webserver will go into your __privateB__ subnet

🌈 Woo hoo! You have created 2 EC2 Instances configured as webservers! 🌈

Tip: give each of these instances a name in the EC2 console to make them easier to identify later. You can call them `webserver-A` and `webserver-B` to keep things simple

### 🚀 Launch 1 EC2 instance into your public subnet
This instance will serve as a jumpbox so that we can test connectivity from our public to our private subnet and confirm that our web servers are set up correctly.

1. Services > Compute > EC2 > Launch Instance
2. Choose *Amazon Linux 2 AMI* > t2.micro
3. Click *Next: Configure Instance Details*
4. Select the cloud-networking-bootcamp VPC and the associated __public__ subnet
5. Ensure that "Auto-assign Public IP" is set to "Enable"
6. Assign the IAM role created earlier with SSM permissions
7. Next until you get to *Configure Security Group* > Create new Security Group
8. Security Group name: __network-testing-sg__
9. __No Rules needed for the Security Group, we're going to use SSM to connect__
10.  Review and Launch > Launch
11.  Proceed without key pair > Launch

### Let's test the connectivity of our EC2 Instances

![Ping Webservers](images/ping-webservers.png)

We're going to use SSM to ping our webservers's. SSM is an agent that allows us to to connect to our EC2s using the Session Manager in the AWS Console.
Why ping? This will let us know if the correct route tables have been set up to access resources in our private subnet.

1. Services > Management & Governance > Systems Manager
2. Select __Session Manager__ on the left hand side
3. Select __Start Session__
4. Select your __public EC2__ instance from the list of instances
5. A new tab should open with a terminal on your NAT instance!
6. type `ping 10.0.1.x` You should see some responses come back from the web server (this should be the IP address of one of your web servers launched above. You can find the IP address of your web server instances in the EC2 under `Private IPs`. As we'll be using these addresses again later, it might be a good idea to note them down to avoid switching back and forth between tabs). 
7. Press `ctrl+c` to stop pinging the server
8. try pinging your other web server to ensure that's also set up correctly

🌈 Woo hoo! You have tested your connection to your EC2 instances via your public subnet! 🌈

<details><summary>📌 Networking Troubleshooting</summary><p>
- Double check your security groups are correct
- Check your instances are deployed into the correct VPC/Subnet
- Double check your route tables are correctly configured
</p></details>

### Let's now test our web servers
1. Follow the Session Manager instructions above to get a terminal on our public EC2 instance
2. Type `curl -v 10.0.1.x` where the IP is that of your first web server (you can find the IP address of your web server instances in the EC2 under `Private IPs`)
3. Inspect the text returned, it should say `Rainbows are the c00lest!`
4. Now try the same, but change the IP address to your second server
5. You should see in the response `Rainbows are the [your adjective]!` this time
   
🌈 Woo hoo! You have now confirmed that your two web servers have been correctly set up! 🌈


### Let's now assign our instances to our load balancer!

1. Services > EC2 > Target Groups > Select your target group you created earlier
2. Go to the 'Targets' Tab
3. Edit 
4. Choose the two __Private Web Servers__ from this list

💁🏼‍♀️ It should look something like this:

![Allocate Instances ELB](images/allocate_instances_alb.png)


Now that you have a public endpoint to your load balancer and 2 web servers, we should be able to see the load balancer in action.
Expected behaviour is that as you refresh your end point, you will see a round-robin behaviour between webserver A and B.

🌈 Woo hoo! You have 2 web servers, connected to a load balancer and it works! 🌈

![You did it!](images/final_vpc_image.png)


You should now have:
  - ✅ 2 EC2's in your __private__ subnet
  - ✅ 1 EC2 in your __public__ subnet
  - ✅ The ability to ping your private EC2's from the public subnets using ssm
  - ✅ The ability to test your ELB using Webserver A and B
